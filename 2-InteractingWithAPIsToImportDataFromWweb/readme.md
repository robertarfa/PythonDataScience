# API Interaction with Python: A Practical Guide

This repository provides a practical demonstration of interacting with APIs using Python. The focus is on retrieving and parsing data from various APIs, specifically showcasing the use of the `requests` library and JSON handling.

## Core Functionality

This project covers the following key aspects of API interaction:

- **API Basics:** Understanding the fundamental concept of APIs as communication protocols between software applications. Examples include Twitter, Uber, Facebook, and Instagram APIs.

- **Making API Requests:** Utilizing the `requests` library in Python to send HTTP requests to APIs. This includes constructing URLs with query parameters.

- **JSON Handling:** Parsing JSON responses from APIs using the built-in `json` method of the `requests` library's `Response` objects. The process of converting JSON data into Python dictionaries is illustrated.

- **Query String Parameters:** Understanding and constructing query strings to specify parameters in API requests. This is exemplified using the OMDb API to retrieve movie data based on title.

## Example: OMDb API

A detailed example uses the Open Movie Database (OMDb) API. The code demonstrates how to:

1. Construct a URL including query parameters (e.g., `?t=hackers` to retrieve information about the movie "Hackers").
2. Send an HTTP request using `requests.get()`.
3. Parse the JSON response into a Python dictionary.
4. Access and utilize the data contained within the dictionary.

The example URL structure (`http://www.omdbapi.com/?t=hackers`) is explained, breaking down the components: base URL, and the query string. The significance of the query string in customizing API requests is emphasized.

## Resources

- **OMDb API Documentation:** The example leverages the OMDb API; its official documentation should be consulted for detailed parameter specifications and usage guidelines.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12.4
- `requests` library (install via `pip install requests`)
